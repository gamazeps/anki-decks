The core promoter is the regions __; +/-50bp of the TSS
TBP (acronym); TATA box Binding Protein
Number of subunits in RNA pol II; 12
The role of core promoters is to __; place the catalytic site of RNA pol II in a suitable position
Number of proteins that can bind to core promoters; more than 50
TAFs (acronym); TBP Associated Factors
RNA Pol II associates with __; TAFIIs
TBP and TAFs assemble to form __; TFIID
TFIID stabilises the DNA (due to displacement of nucleosomes) via __; HAT activity of TAF1
Pol II is [capabale/not capable] of recognizing specific DNA binding sequences; not capable
DNA opening during transcription is mediated by __; TFIIH
The transcription start is determined by __; the position of Pol II with regards to TFIID
The TATA box is located __ of the TSS; ~30bps upstream
TATA box are named that way because __; thir consensus sequence is TATAWADR
The TBP-DNA complex is stabilized by __; TFIIA and TFIIB
__% of mamalian core promoters carry a functional TATA box; 10-20%
The consensus sequence for the initiator (Inr) elements is located; overlaps the TSS
The Inr elements initiates transcription by; recruiting TAF1 and TAF2, then TFIID like TATA mechanism
SP1 binds in region __; with high "GC" content
SP1 binds in core promoters of ____ genes ____; housekeeping / missing both TATA and Inr
SP1 (acronym); Specific Protein 1
Core promoters [have/don't have] the same size; don't have, there are sharp and broad ones
Sharp core promoters are more likely to contain __; TATA box
Sharp core promoters are preferentialy used for __; Tissue-specific genes
Broad core promoters are more likely to contain __; CpG islands
Sharp core promoters are preferentialy used for __; Housekeeping genes
In humans most protein coding genes have [a single / more than one] TSS regions; more than one
The protein complexes involved in transcriptional regulation have [dynamic/static] structure, meaning that their structure [varies / stays the same] over time; dynamic, varies
TFIID role; Recognizes TATA box near the TSS
TFIIA role; TBP-DNA stabilization
TFIIB role; TBP-DNA stabilization, recruitment of TFIIF
TFIIF role; Pol II interraction and recruitment to promoter
TFIIE role; Pol II initiation, recruits TFIIH
TFIIH role; Releases RNA Pol II from promoter, and opens DNA during transcription
The role of the mediator complex is __; to communicate regulatory signals to RNA Pol II
RNA Pol II and CDK8 bindings to the mediator complex are [independant/mutually dependant/mutually exclusive]; mutually exclusive
The Mediator complex contains __ subunits in humans; 26 subunits
Transcription can interract with [all / specific] mediator subunits; specific
