Current focus for ligands to the transferrin receptor; enhancing delivery to skeletal and cardiac muscle and across the blood-brain barrier [74]
Toxic effects (dose dependency); dose-dependent [75]
Correlation of most chronic toxicities; with the total cumulative dose [75]
Correlation of some toxicities; with the peak drug concentration in an organ [75]
Plasma (consideration as an organ); a liquid organ [75]
Role of plasma; to integrate a number of stress responsive pathways [76]
Stress responsive pathways integrated by plasma; clotting cascade, complement cascade, Kinin-kallikrein cascade, acute phase reactant cascades, angiotensinogen cascade [76]
Key roles of blood cells and vascular endothelium; binding to various members of these pathways, including PS ASOs [76]
Abundant cell type playing a surface-activating role in plasma; platelets [76]
Origin and activation of protein factors in cascades; made in the liver as pro-proteins, activated by proteolytic cleavage [76]
Risk of activating these systems; activation of adaptive immunity and production of deleterious auto-antibodies [77]
Binding of PS ASOs to clotting factors; bind to liver-derived vitamin K dependent clotting factors [77]
Deleterious consequences observed from PS ASO binding to clotting factors; never observed any [77]
Binding of PS ASOs in the complement pathway; bind to factor H [78]
Factor H (role in complement pathway); key negative regulator of complement activation [78]
Factor H (species variation); vary among different species [78]
Affinity of NHP factor H for PS ASOs vs human factor H; NHP factor H appears to have a higher affinity [78, 79]
Effect of high PS ASO doses in NHP tox studies; complement activation in some animals [78]
Acute NHP deaths in early technology development (cause); complement activation [78]
NHP strains/types sensitivity to PS ASOs; Mauritius NHPs are the most sensitive [80]
Acute complement activation or adverse events observed in humans with PS ASOs; never observed any [79, 80]
Conditions for rare thrombocytopenia with PS 2’-MOE gapmers; very high chronic inflammation (e.g., TTR amyloidosis, familial chylomicronemia), >4 months dosing, 300mg/week S.C. [80]
Mechanism of thrombocytopenia from PS ASOs; binding to platelets, possibly slight complement activation, and anti-PS ASO anti-platelet antibodies [81]
Dependency of thrombocytopenia process; high peak plasma PS ASO concentrations [81]
Strategy to avoid thrombocytopenia risk (PS ASO doses); do not administer doses greater than 200-250mg [82]
Strategy for doses ≥300mg in humans to avoid toxicity; divide doses (e.g., two 150mg S.C. doses separated by 60 minutes) [83]
Binding of PS ASOs to plasma albumin; ensures they are not cleared rapidly in urine by filtration by the kidney [83]
PS ASO binding to albumin (drug-drug interactions); no drug-drug interactions due to albumin binding (don't bind at small molecule sites) [83]
Effects of PS ASOs on clotting factors (clinical significance); transient, not associated with clinically significant sequelae [79]
First step in ASO technology evolution (pharmacology); development of a theoretical framework to rationalize pharmacological observations [84]
Two essential concepts for adapting receptor theory to ASOs; RNAs as potential receptors and ASOs as agents altering RNA intermediary metabolism [84, 85]
Length of typical ASOs (nucleotides); 18-20 nucleotides [32, 84]
Potential number of receptor sites for ASOs in a pre-mRNA or mRNA; millions [84]
Three phases of pharmacological effects of drugs; Pre-receptor binding, receptor binding, and post-receptor binding [86]
Pre-receptor binding phase (drug action); drug "sampling biological space to identify its cognate binding site or receptor" [86]
Process in pre-receptor binding phase; drug binds to many sites, dissociates, and binds to progressively higher affinity sites [86]
Speed of pre-receptor binding phase for most drugs; quite rapid [86]
Speed of receptor binding phase for most drugs; extremely rapid [86]
Post-receptor binding phase (initiation); drug binding initiates a biological response (signal transduction) [86]
Effect of signal transduction on drug effect; amplifies it [86]
Speed and limitation of signal transduction; usually rapid and self-limited [86]
Source of most basic principles of ASO pharmacology; study of PS ASOs that form duplexes cleaved by RNase H1 [87]
Presence of free PS ASO in cells at pharmacological doses; likely little to no free PS ASO [88]
Reason for little to no free PS ASO in cells; extensive protein and nucleic acid binding [88]
Determination of PS ASO concentration at cellular sites; product of Kds for binding sites and concentration of those sites [88]
Mechanism of PS ASO binding to cognate RNA sequences; likely involves transfer from a protein or partially matched RNA sequence [88]
Accumulation of PS ASOs in mitochondria; never observed appreciable concentrations [89]
PS ASO activity observed in mitochondria; none observed [89]
Types of RNA PS ASOs can target in the cell; all types [90]
Effect of RNA structure on accessible sites for PS ASOs; more structured RNA means fewer accessible sites [90]
Highly structured/modified RNAs that PS ASOs can target; pre-r or rRNAs, small molecular weight RNAs, and tRNAs [90]
Other RNAs easily targeted by PS ASOs; Circular, long non-coding, and micro-RNAs [90]
Locations in the cell where PS ASOs can produce pharmacological effects; throughout the cell (except mitochondria) [91]
Specific locations of PS ASO activity in the nucleus; nucleus, nucleolus, paraspeckles, spliceosomes, and during transcription [91]
Specific locations of PS ASO activity in the cytoplasm; polysome and cytosol [91]
Purpose of ASOs; designed to produce a desired effect in humans (pharmacological agents) [91]
Purpose of most drugs; to treat or prevent disease, not "cure" [91]
Duration of treatment for most chronic diseases; continuous [91]
Purpose of dosing intervals; to replace drug that is metabolized and cleared, maintaining steady drug effect [91]
ASO binding sites; target sites, considered "receptors" [92]
Primary effort in drug discovery; to identify chemicals that can interact selectively with desired receptors [92]
Relationship between drug selectivity and therapeutic index; more selective drug means better therapeutic index [92]
Most important parameter to know about a drug; therapeutic index [93]
Most common calculation for therapeutic index; dose producing 50% maximal desired effect divided by dose producing half-maximal adverse effects [93]
Relationship between therapeutic index value and drug quality; greater therapeutic index means better drug [93]
Definition of a drug receptor; a site to which the drug binds that is coupled to a biological response that amplifies the effects of the drug [93]
Example of a drug acceptor; serum albumin [93]
Why serum albumin is a drug acceptor, not a receptor; binds many drugs but is not coupled to a biological response [93]
"Receptors" for ASOs (molecular nature); complimentary sequences in RNAs [94]
How ASOs achieve extraordinary specificity for target RNA sequence; use the genetic code [94]
Difference between traditional receptors and ASO "receptors" in coupling to biological response; traditional are directly coupled, ASO receptors are not [35, 94]
How ASOs produce effects on RNA; alter production or abundance, or maturation to final functional form [94]
Strength of ASO technology (versatility); can be designed to bind any type of RNA and cause degradation, altered processing, or blocked functions [94]
